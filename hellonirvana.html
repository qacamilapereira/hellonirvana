            Load up on guns, bring your friends <br>
            It's fun to lose and to pretend <br>
            She's over-bored and self-assured <br>
            Oh, no, I know a dirty word <br>

            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello <br>

            With the lights out <br>
            It's less dangerous <br>
            Here we are now, entertain us <br>
            I feel stupid and contagious <br>
            Here we are now, entertain us <br>
            A mulatto, an albino <br>
            A mosquito, my libido <br>
            Yeah, hey, yay <br>

            I'm worse at what I do best <br>
            And for this gift I feel blessed <br>
            Our little group has always been <br>
            And always will until the end <br>

            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello <br>

            With the lights out <br>
            It's less dangerous <br>
            Here we are now, entertain us <br>
            I feel stupid and contagious <br>
            Here we are now, entertain us <br>
            A mulatto, an albino <br>
            A mosquito, my libido <br>
            Yeah, hey, yay <br>

            And I forget just why I taste <br>
            Oh, yeah, I guess it makes me smile <br>
            I found it hard, it's hard to find <br>
            Well, whatever, nevermind <br>

            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low <br>
            Hello, hello, hello <br>

            With the lights out <br>
            It's less dangerous <br>
            Here we are now, entertain us <br>
            I feel stupid and contagious <br>
            Here we are now, entertain us <br>
            A mulatto, an albino <br>
            A mosquito, my libido <br>

            A denial, a denial, a denial <br>
            A denial, a denial, a denial <br>
            A denial, a denial, a denial <br>
